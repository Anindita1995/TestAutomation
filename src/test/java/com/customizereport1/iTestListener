In this package we are using ITestListener

Using ITestListener Interface:We use ITestListener interface when we need to customize
real time report. In other words, if we are executing the bunch of test cases, in a TestNG suit
and we want to get the report of each test case, then after each test case we need to implement
ITestListener interface. This interface will override onTestFailure, onTestStart, onTestSkipped
method to send the correct status of the current test case.

here are the test we are following:
step1: Create LoginTN_CustomizeReport.java and implement iTestListener in it.
step2: Implement methods of iTestListener. (onStart, onTestStart,onTestsuccess.......)
step3: Create test method class (Login_TN) write test methods, and add LoginTN_CustomizeReport
class as a Listener in Test Method class.
